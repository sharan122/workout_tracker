Generate Python code for the Singleton design pattern. The implementation should be simple, with a real-world example. Do not include any comments or explanations.

This blog post is part of the Python Code for Singleton pattern. If you are interested in writing a Python code for the Singleton pattern, you can learn about it in the blog post.

Singleton Design Patterns

The Singleton pattern is a conceptually simple way of implementing a singleton class for a class that is created by a Singleton class.

Singleton classes are not intended to be instantiated. They are meant to work together (i.e. they can be instantiated without creating an instance) and they are not intended to be part of a singleton class (as such, the Singleton class is not responsible for the creation of its own instance).

The Singleton class is intended as a singleton class for this blog post.

Singleton Classes

Singleton classes can be instantiated without creating an instance and they are just a way of creating a Singleton class.

Singleton Classes are not meant to be part of a singleton class. They are meant to work together (i.e. they can be instant
